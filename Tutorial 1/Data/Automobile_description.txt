Automobile Dataset

--- 

This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, 
(b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. 

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that 
it is probably pretty safe (target variable).

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a "class" attribute.

Attribute Information:

Attribute: Attribute Range

mitsubishi, nissan, peugot, plymouth, porsche,
renault, saab, subaru, toyota, volkswagen, volvo

4. fuel-type: diesel, gas.
5. aspiration: std, turbo.
6. num-of-doors: four, two.
7. body-style: hardtop, wagon, sedan, hatchback, convertible.
8. drive-wheels: 4wd, fwd, rwd.
9. engine-location: front, rear.
10. wheel-base: continuous from 86.6 120.9.
	horizontal distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels

11. length: continuous from 141.1 to 208.1.
12. width: continuous from 60.3 to 72.3.
13. height: continuous from 47.8 to 59.8.

14. curb-weight: continuous from 1488 to 4066.
	Your car’s curb weight is the weight when the car has no passengers and no cargo. All the necessary fluids like engine oil, coolant, window washer fluid, and fuel are included in the weighing process. https://curbweights.com/

15. engine-type: dohc, dohcv, l, ohc, ohcf, ohcv, rotor.
16. num-of-cylinders: eight, five, four, six, three, twelve, two.
17. engine-size: continuous from 61 to 326.
18. fuel-system: 1bbl, 2bbl, 4bbl, idi, mfi, mpfi, spdi, spfi.

19. bore: continuous from 2.54 to 3.94.
	In a piston engine, the bore (or cylinder bore) is the diameter of each cylinder.

20. stroke: continuous from 2.07 to 4.17. 
	"Stroke length", the distance travelled by the piston during each cycle. The stroke length––along with bore diameter––determines the engine's displacement.

21. compression-ratio: continuous from 7 to 23.
22. horsepower: continuous from 48 to 288.

23. peak-rpm: continuous from 4150 to 6600. 
	Revolutions per minute, and it’s used as a measure of how fast any machine is operating at a given time. In cars, rpm measures how many times the engine’s crankshaft makes one full rotation every minute, and along with it, how many times each piston goes up and down in its cylinder

24. city-mpg: continuous from 13 to 49.
25. highway-mpg: continuous from 16 to 54.
26. price: continuous from 5118 to 45400.
